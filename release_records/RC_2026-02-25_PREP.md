## Candidate Metadata
1. Candidate ID: `RC_2026-02-25_PREP`
2. Target stage (`rc` or `ga`): `rc`
3. Commit SHA: `307cf4f` (pre-remediation snapshot)
4. Build timestamp (UTC): `2026-02-26`
5. Evaluated by: `Codex session (prep)`

## Gate A: Technical Confidence
- [x] Linux full smoke pass evidence attached.
  Evidence: `scripts/build_and_smoke_wsl.sh` local pass on 2026-02-25.
- [x] Windows status smoke pass evidence attached.
  Evidence: `scripts/build_and_smoke_windows.ps1 -SkipGpuSmoke` local pass on 2026-02-25.
- [x] C API status-contract smoke pass evidence attached.
  Evidence: `scripts/smoke_core_status.py` pass on Linux and Windows.
- [x] No unresolved `P0` defects.
- [x] All `P1` defects resolved or waiver attached.
  Evidence: `release_records/evidence/RC_2026-02-26_PREP/issue_triage_rc2.md` (`P1` open count now `0`).

## Gate B: Operability and Reproducibility
- [x] Two consecutive green CI runs on target branch.
  Evidence: `release_records/evidence/RC_2026-02-26_PREP/ci_run_snapshot.md`:
  1. `cuda-cross-platform` runs `#19` and `#18` both `success`.
  2. `quality-gates` runs `#17` and `#16` both `success`.
- [x] Clean rebuild reproducibility verified.
  Evidence: local WSL and Windows rebuild/smoke runs on 2026-02-25.
- [x] Benchmark smoke artifact attached (`linux-core-benchmark-smoke`).
  Note: artifact upload step added in workflow; pending CI confirmation.

## Gate C: Performance Evidence
- [x] Core benchmark run executed with `scripts/benchmark_core_cuda.py`.
- [x] Benchmark CSV artifact attached.
  Evidence: `/tmp/iir2d_core_bench_smoke.csv`, `/tmp/iir2d_core_bench_smoke2.csv` (local prep runs).
- [x] p50/p95 and throughput metrics reviewed.
- [x] Command lines + environment metadata documented.
  Evidence: `docs/BENCHMARK_PROTOCOL.md`, `README.md`.

## Gate D: Commercial Readiness
- [x] Packaging/install docs validated for this stage.
  Evidence: `setup.py` now supports pure wheel mode via `IIR2D_SKIP_EXT=1` and `.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml` emits wheel + report-pack artifacts.
- [x] Legal/security obligations for this stage reviewed.
  Evidence: `LICENSE` (MIT), `NOTICE`, `SECURITY.md`, and `dependency-license-scan.yml` are in-place and already gated in CI.
- [x] Open issue list triaged and accepted.
  Evidence: `release_records/evidence/RC_2026-02-26_PREP/issue_triage_rc2.md`.

2. Scope: `none`
3. Risk: `none`
4. Owner: `n/a`
5. Expiry: `n/a`
6. Approval: `n/a`
