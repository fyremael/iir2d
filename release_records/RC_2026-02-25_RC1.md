2. Role:
3. Name:
4. Date (UTC):
5. Evidence checked: `[A1, A2, ...]`
6. Blocking issue (if reject): `none` or details

## Gate A: Technical Confidence
- [x] Linux full smoke pass evidence attached.
  Evidence: `scripts/build_and_smoke_wsl.sh` local pass on 2026-02-25.
- [x] Windows status smoke pass evidence attached.
  Evidence: `scripts/build_and_smoke_windows.ps1 -SkipGpuSmoke` local pass on 2026-02-25.
- [x] C API status-contract smoke pass evidence attached.
  Evidence: `scripts/smoke_core_status.py` pass on Linux and Windows.
- [x] No unresolved `P0` defects.
- [x] All `P1` defects resolved or waiver attached.
  Evidence: `release_records/evidence/RC_2026-02-25_RC1/issue_triage_rc1.md`.

## Gate B: Operability and Reproducibility
- [x] Two consecutive green CI runs on target branch.
  Evidence: runs `#4` and `#5` (both `success`) on `main`:
  1. `https://github.com/fyremael/iir2d/actions/runs/22386416822`
  2. `https://github.com/fyremael/iir2d/actions/runs/22386444587`
- [x] Clean rebuild reproducibility verified.
  Evidence: local WSL and Windows rebuild/smoke runs on 2026-02-25.
- [x] Benchmark smoke artifact attached (`linux-core-benchmark-smoke`).
  Evidence: artifact id `5649157110` from run `#5`:
  `https://github.com/fyremael/iir2d/actions/runs/22386444587/artifacts/5649157110`.

Gate B qualification note (2026-02-25 UTC):
1. Self-hosted runners were registered for Linux and Windows (`iir2d-linux-selfhosted-01`, `iir2d-win-selfhosted-01`).
2. For runs `#4` and `#5`, self-hosted CUDA jobs succeeded on both OS targets.
3. Hosted bootstrap jobs were skipped (expected with `IIR2D_USE_SELF_HOSTED=true`).

## Gate C: Performance Evidence
- [x] Core benchmark run executed with `scripts/benchmark_core_cuda.py`.
- [x] Benchmark CSV artifact attached.
  Evidence: `/tmp/iir2d_core_bench_smoke.csv`, `/tmp/iir2d_core_bench_smoke2.csv` (local runs).
- [x] p50/p95 and throughput metrics reviewed.
- [x] Command lines + environment metadata documented.
  Evidence: `BENCHMARK_PROTOCOL.md`, `README.md`.

## Gate D: Commercial Readiness

- [x] Open issue list triaged and accepted.
  Evidence: `release_records/evidence/RC_2026-02-25_RC1/issue_triage_rc1.md`.

## Waivers (if any)

5. Expiry: `2026-03-31 UTC`
6. Approval: `approved by Product Lead directive (2026-02-25T06:21:54Z)`
7. Waiver ID: `WAIVER-RC1-CI-SELFHOST-001`
8. Scope: `RC stage only`
9. Risk: `no self-hosted CUDA runners registered; CI green evidence is control-plane fallback only`
10. Owner: `Platform Engineer`
11. Expiry: `2026-03-31 UTC`
12. Approval: `accepted under Product Lead promotion directive`
13. Status: `resolved on 2026-02-25T07:19:06Z after self-hosted runs #4/#5 succeeded`
