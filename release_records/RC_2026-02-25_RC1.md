6. Approval: `approved by Product Lead directive (2026-02-25T06:21:54Z)`

## Sign-off
| Role | Name | Decision (`approve`/`reject`) | Date (UTC) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core Kernel Engineer |  |  |  |  |
| Platform Engineer |  |  |  |  |
| QA Engineer |  |  |  |  |

## Promotion Decision
1. Final decision (`promote`/`hold`): `promote`
2. Decision timestamp (UTC): `2026-02-25T06:21:54Z`
3. Decision owner: `Product Lead (user directive)`
4. Follow-ups (post-promotion):
