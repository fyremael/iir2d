# RC1 Issue Triage (P0/P1)

Date (UTC): 2026-02-25
Reviewer: Codex session (pre-sign-off triage)

## Inputs Reviewed
1. `task_board.md` risks/blockers log.
2. Latest local gate evidence logs in this directory.
3. Local build/smoke outcomes for Linux and Windows status path.

## Classification
1. `P0` (release blocker): none identified in current tracked issues.
2. `P1` (requires resolve or waiver before promotion): none explicitly tracked as `P1`.
3. Open non-P1 risks:
   1. Performance competitiveness risk (`open`).
   2. Ambiguous quality claims risk (`in_progress`, protocol drafted).

## Notes
1. This triage is pre-sign-off and must be confirmed by QA + Product Lead.
2. If CI reveals new regressions, triage must be refreshed before promotion decision.
