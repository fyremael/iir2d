## Day 0 - Intro
Subject: CUDA image pipeline pilot (3-week, evidence-first)

Hi <Name>,

We built a CUDA-native 2D recursive filter core with strict status contracts and reproducible benchmark evidence.  
If you own a latency-sensitive image stage, we can run a 3-week design-partner pilot with clear success criteria (p50/p95 latency, reliability, integration effort).

If useful, I can send a 20-minute technical walkthrough and a proposed pilot scope aligned to your stack.

Best,  
<Sender>

## Day 2 - Evidence Follow-up
Subject: Re: CUDA image pipeline pilot (benchmark protocol attached)

Sharing the benchmark protocol and claim-evidence process we use so results are auditable:
1. `BENCHMARK_PROTOCOL.md`
2. claims packet workflow (`scripts/build_benchmark_claims_packet.py`)

If you share your representative shape/filter path, we can pre-scope the exact workload matrix before kickoff.

## Day 5 - Final Nudge
Subject: Last check - hold a March pilot slot?

If this is still relevant, we can hold one of three March pilot slots and lock a 3-week plan with a dated go/no-go checkpoint.

If timing is off, no problem; I can circle back next quarter.
